# Welcome to Ayla Yersel's portfolio site!

## A few things about me:
#### A librarian by day and Computer Science major by night, I discovered my love of coding in 2020, when I took a free Ruby course on a whim through Lynda.com. Now I spend most of my free time tinkering with JavaScript and Java projects, or writing beginner-friendly coding tutorials on my blog, [Lady Codes](lady-codes.com).
